Use break
1. Write a loop 1 to 200. Use break to exit the loop once you find 100.

2. Write a while loop that adds numbers starting from 1, but stops (using break) as soon as the sum reaches or exceeds 100

3. Write a loop that goes from 1 to 100, but stops (using break) when it encounters the first square number (like 4, 9, 16, etc.)

Use continue
1. Write a loop to print even numbers from 1 to 40. Use continue to skip odd numbers.

2. display odd number from 55 to 85 and skip the numbers divisible by 5.


Use for loop
1. "I will invest at least 6 hrs every single day for next 60 days!" this message 60 times. So display this.
2. Find all the odd numbers from 61 to 100.
3. Find all the even numbers from 78 to 98.
4. Display sum of all the odd numbers from 91 to 129.
